## Fast and Clean

### Do stuff faster (and cleaner?) with [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html)

### Do stuff cleaner (and faster?) with [broom](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/broom/vignettes/broom.html)

## dplyr

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'markup'}
knitr::kable(data_frame(Function = c("`select()`", "`filter()`", "`mutate()`", "`summarise()`", "`group_by()`", "`left_join()`"),
                        Action = c("Select colums", "Filter rows", "Add columns", 
                                   "Summarize columns", "Perform grouped operations", "SQL-like join operations")))
```

## broom

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'markup'}
knitr::kable(data_frame(Function = c("`tidy()`", "`glance()`", "`augment()`"),
                        Action = c("Summarize model findings (like `summary()`)", 
                                   "Concise *one-row* model summary", 
                                   "Add columns to modeled data (like `predict()`)")))
```

## Other Packages (used today)

- [Lahman](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Lahman/index.html)
- [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html)
- [magrittr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html)

### The Basics:

- `x %>% f` is the same as `f(x)`
- `x %>% f(y, .)` is the same as `f(y, x)`

## A Data Question

## Knowing Your Data (with Mark McGwire)

```{r}
Batting %>% 
  filter(playerID == "mcgwima01") %>% 
  select(playerID, teamID, yearID, HR) %>% 
  filter(yearID == 1997)
```

## Knowing Your Data (with Mark McGwire)

```{r}
Batting %>% 
  filter(playerID == "mcgwima01") %>% 
  group_by(playerID, yearID) %>% 
  summarise(HR = sum(HR)) %>% 
  filter(yearID == 1997)
```

## Home Run Data

```{r}
hr <- Batting %>% 
  group_by(playerID, yearID) %>% 
  summarise(HR = sum(HR)) %>%  
  ungroup %>% 
  filter(HR >= 40) %>% 
  group_by(playerID) %>% 
  summarise(seasons = n(),
            last_year = max(yearID)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(seasons))
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
hr
```


## Player Name Data

```{r}
players <- Master %>% 
  tbl_df %>% 
  select(playerID, nameFirst, nameLast) %>% 
  mutate(letters_last = nchar(nameLast))
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
players
```

## The Solution

```{r}
hr %>% 
  left_join(players, by = "playerID")  %>% 
  filter(letters_last <= 4)
```

## Another Data Question

What is the relationship between a baseball team's yearly player salaries
and the team's winning percentage?

## Team Salaries vs. Win Percentage

### Salaries (in millions)
```{r}
money <- Salaries %>% 
  group_by(yearID, teamID) %>% 
  summarise(total_salary = sum(salary) / 1000000)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
money
```


## Team Salaries vs. Win Percentage

### Winning percentage
```{r, warning = FALSE}
wins <- Teams %>% 
  tbl_df %>% 
  filter(yearID >= 1985) %>% 
  mutate(win_pct = W / (W + L) * 100) %>% 
  select(yearID, teamID, win_pct, LgWin, WSWin) %>% 
  left_join(money, by = c("yearID", "teamID"))
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
wins
```

## Team Salaries vs. Win Percentage

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5, fig.align = "center", dev = "svg"}
## Yearly plots
wins %>% 
  filter(yearID <= 1999) %>% 
  mutate(LgWin = ifelse(is.na(LgWin), "N", LgWin),
         WSWin = ifelse(is.na(WSWin), "N", WSWin)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(total_salary, win_pct)) +
  facet_wrap(~yearID, scales = "free_x", nr = 3) +
  geom_point(aes(color = LgWin, shape = WSWin), alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  ylab("Win Percentage") +
  xlab("Total Team Salary (in millons)") +
  scale_color_manual(name = "League Champ", values = c("black", "red")) +
  scale_shape_discrete(name = "World Series Champ") +
  theme(legend.position = "top",
        legend.box = "horizontal",
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8))
```

## Team Salaries vs. Win Percentage

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5, fig.align = "center", dev = "svg"}
## Yearly plots
wins %>% 
  filter( yearID >= 2000) %>% 
  mutate(LgWin = ifelse(is.na(LgWin), "N", LgWin),
         WSWin = ifelse(is.na(WSWin), "N", WSWin)) %>%

```

## Summarize the (2014) Model

The model

```{r}
m1 <- lm(win_pct ~ total_salary, data = filter(wins, yearID == 2014))
m1
```

## Summarize the (2014) Model

**Without** broom

```{r}
summary(m1)
```

## Summarize the (2014) Model

**Without** broom

```{r}
summary(m1)$coefficients["total_salary", "Pr(>|t|)"]
```

## Summarize the (2014) Model

**With** broom

```{r}
tidy(m1)
```

## Test ALL the Model Slopes

**Without** broom

```{r}
sapply(split(wins, wins$yearID), function(x) {
  mm <- lm(win_pct ~ total_salary, data = x)
  summary(mm)$coefficients["total_salary", "Pr(>|t|)"]
})
```

## Test ALL the Model Slopes

**With** broom

```{r}
wins %>% 
  group_by(yearID) %>% 
  do(tidy(lm(win_pct ~ total_salary, data = .))) %>% 
  filter(term == "total_salary")
```

## Many thanks to...

- Hadley Wickham (dplyr, ggplot2)
- David Robinson (broom) [not the Admiral]
- Stefan Milton Bache (magrittr)
- Yihui Xie (knitr)
- JJ Allaire (rmarkdown)
- Sean Lahman and Michael Friendly (Lahman)
- and others that contributed to the R packages used today

Lastly, thank you to Ben Baumer for laying out an excellent way to 
introduce dplyr (which I shamelessly stole from [here](http://www.science.smith.edu/~bbaumer/jsm2015.html#1)).
